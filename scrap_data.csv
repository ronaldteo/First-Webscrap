Ritz Carlton,"Everything was perfect!
The best aspect of this hotel is the quanlity of the hotel staff. They were very welcoming and took care of every need starting with early check-in. They were super kind, polite, and knew their jobs.
The hotel location is perfect. Many must-see tourist attractions are at walking distance. Taxi cab guys are easily available (both normal cabs and the ones on Grab). MBS is just across the helix bridge. Airport was a 15 min drive.
Breakfast at the hotel is very good with a variety of items from different cuisines (Indian, Chinese, Singaporean, Western etc.). Food is good for vegetarians. In-room dining also has decent options for vegetarians. They'll also fix something not on the menu to suit your dietary requirements.
The art inside the hotel is also a must-see. We had a good time going around checking various paintings and sculptures.
Ritz-Kids is a great idea. My daughter loved it.
This hotel is the kind that makes your holiday. I will highly recommend staying at this property.",10.0,Positive

Ritz Carlton,"…everything was so amazing. We had club lounge access and it was absolutely worth it. Wonderful food and lovely drinks. It even improved since I was there before Covid. I remember lively Peter who treated us so nicely - but it’s so unfair because everybody was so sweet and made us feel at home. 
what I liked is that it was very quiet and decent in the club lodge and no kids running around and screaming. Also not overcrowded or annoying guests￼ - that makes a stay really memorable
Thank you!..￼",10.0,Positive

Ritz Carlton,The service is more than excellent. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay special. Fahzil in the club room and Azman in the gym (sorry if I spelt names wrong) were so lovely in making us feel welcome and paid special attention to our needs from start to finish. We have stayed in Singapore many times and would have to say that this is by far the best hotel we have been to. We can highly recommend and would not hesitate to stay again.

Ritz Carlton,"This property was exceptional and exceeded our expectations. You get the FULL five star service here. Staff are so welcoming and running to your aid from the moment you check in.

May I suggest booking a room on a higher floor, our view of the City was nothing short of amazing and gave our stay that extra ounce of Wow factor! It made our stay here even more memorable.

The Scarlet Singapore,"Location is excellent, away from the tourist milieu and very close to MRT.  Located in Chinatown is a way better option than one of the mainstream hotels in shopping alley (Orchard Rd) - unless you are a shopaholic.  I liked the idea of the hotel being in remodelled shophouses - this added to the quirkyness of the interior layout.  The mini bar provided soft drinks and a couple of beers each day (without charge) and the rooms were small but comfortable with a bit of an 'olde world Singapore' look and feel to them.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  
If you like Hawker Centre food, the Maxwell centre is  5 mins away and Chinatown proper only another 5 mins away.  We were there for five nights and being Durian fruit lovers were able to end the day with a different type of durian fruit feast each evening prior to our return to the hotel.
Overall, different but better than a stay in the mainstream tourist hotels...
We would stay here again.",8.0,Positive

The Scarlet Singapore,"The room, like all in Singapore is a little smaller than most European /USA/Australian travelers would be used to. Having said that, the room was spotlessly clean, well appointed and met our needs perfectly.   Nice touches were the FREE endless mini bar. replenished every day at no cost. The MRT (subway) is a short stroll and Chinatown close by. All in all a very good place to stay in central Singapore, close to transport options. The staff were also excellent and very professional.",9.0,Positive
The Scarlet Singapore,"Location was fabulous, room was generous in size and hotel staff so helpful. Cleanliness was great too",8.0,Positive
The Scarlet Singapore,"The hotel's location is excellent, right next to the Maxwell SMRT station with easy access to the rest of the city. While it's next to Chinatown, it's also next to Club Street, with many bars and restaurants that are very cosmopolitan to choose from. The staff are extremely helpful and the room, while a little quirky, is well-equipped with anything most guests would need. The complimentary mini-bar was basic but well-stocked and a bonus when coming back to the room in the evening, looking for a quick snack.",9.0,Positive

The Scarlet Singapore,"Location is excellent, away from the tourist milieu and very close to MRT.  Located in Chinatown is a way better option than one of the mainstream hotels in shopping alley (Orchard Rd) - unless you are a shopaholic.  I liked the idea of the hotel being in remodelled shophouses - this added to the quirkyness of the interior layout.  The mini bar provided soft drinks and a couple of beers each day (without charge) and the rooms were small but comfortable with a bit of an 'olde world Singapore' look and feel to them.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  
If you like Hawker Centre food, the Maxwell centre is  5 mins away and Chinatown proper only another 5 mins away.  We were there for five nights and being Durian fruit lovers were able to end the day with a different type of durian fruit feast each evening prior to our return to the hotel.
Overall, different but better than a stay in the mainstream tourist hotels...
We would stay here again.",8.0,Positive
The Scarlet Singapore,"The staffs were very helpful. Bathroom was clean. Refrigerator was always filled up with goodies.
